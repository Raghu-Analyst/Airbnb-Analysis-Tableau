# Exploring Airbnb Data with Tableau

Welcome to my project on analyzing Airbnb data using Tableau! This repository contains a comprehensive study divided into two parts, aimed at helping users navigate through data exploration, visualization, and dashboard creation.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is the Seattle Airbnb Open Dataset. It includes information on listings, pricing, and reviews, providing a rich source of data for analysis.


## Part 1: Data Exploration and Visualization

In the first part, we delve into the following steps:

1. **Importing Data:** Learn how to import Airbnb data into Tableau efficiently.
2. **Price Analysis:** Explore pricing trends and variations across different zip codes.
3. **Visual Representation:** Create insightful visualizations depicting average prices per zip code.
4. **Temporal Analysis:** Investigate the impact of time on Airbnb prices by visualizing trends over various time periods.
5. **Insights Generation:** Extract valuable insights from visualizations to understand pricing patterns and influencing factors.

## Part 2: Dashboard Creation and Sharing

The second part emphasizes:

1. **Dashboard Integration:** Combine multiple visualizations into a cohesive dashboard layout.
2. **Enhanced Readability:** Add labels and captions to enhance the clarity and understanding of the dashboard.
3. **Visual Refinement:** Fine-tune visualizations for improved presentation and aesthetics.
4. **Sharing Mechanism:** Share the finalized dashboard via Tableau Public for seamless access and collaboration.
5. **Encouraging Exploration:** Provide access to the data source and encourage users to create their unique visualizations for further exploration.
